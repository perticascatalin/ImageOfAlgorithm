Neural Program vs. Cellular Automata - started in graphical review, discussed in related work

Related work (state of art and subject in context) initial plan
================================

SA 1: Program Induction

Many papers, check Google Doc. It also provides considerable background in this field.

SA 2: Hybrid methods

Controlling recurrent networks with conceptors.
From mathematical patterns (chaotic attractors) to movement patterns.

A neural algorithm of artistic style.
Combining texture and content paper.

SA 3: Complex Dynamical Behavior

Related Work starting point quote: "Our classification experiments are performed both on specific classes of programs, as well as family of programs. From this point of view, it is conceptually related to iss ues discussed in [14] (concepts for dynamic patterns) and [15] (behavior of cellular automata)."
