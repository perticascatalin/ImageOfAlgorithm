ae: a MAJOR REVISION  is necessary following the referee comments.


Reviewer #1: 


A - R1a: The abstract is really poor to understand what the article is about.

C: made the experimental part clearer in abstract (P1 & P2)

A - R1b: The state of the art is really poor, it does not allow the reader to see the general framework of the proposal.

C: here should re-read related work and set some graphical connections (SA 1, 2, 3)

================================

SA 1: Program Induction

Many papers, check Google Doc

SA 2: Hybrid methods

Controlling recurrent networks with conceptors.
From mathematical patterns (chaotic attractors) to movement patterns.

A neural algorithm of artistic style.
Combining texture and content paper.

SA 3: Complex Dynamical Behavior

Related Work quote: "Our classification experiments are performed both on specific classes of programs, as well as family of programs. From this point of view, it is conceptually related to iss ues discussed in [14] (concepts for dynamic patterns) and [15] (behavior of cellular automata)."

================================


A - R1c: The main problem of this article is the goal is not clear, it starts in the introduction talking about intelligent agents and enumerate several mechanisms but, for example, the 4th point is talking about a goal in the long run (is that a mechanism? What does it have to do with the rest of points?)

C: The 4th point is simply motivating this study. It's an exploratory topic which we only lightly present at the end of the paper. However, similar ideas in the literature re-inforce the validity of our proposal in this regard (check Hybrid Methods SA 2).

C: On the other hand, the neural algorithms learned by the models, could be considered new programs obeying certain constraints (this is because we say in introduction that we pursuit this direction.)

C: Hybrid programs could be achieved by blending neural execution traces.

A - R1d: It should be necessary to remark that is supposed to be a new field, but only at the end of the paper is mentioned that are not works about this. On the contrary, what is the novelty of the proposal? How to compare this against other proposal? What other proposals are working on this nowadays?

C: These are detailed in the Google Doc, the Google Doc is to be merged into the journal paper

R1e: It is necessary to clearly understand to usefulness of the new field to see if it is worth it or not.

R1f: It is necessary to highlight exactly the steps of the proposal.

R1g: The experiments do not provide any relevant and convincing conclusions, just a few general remarks. 



Reviewer #2: 


The work "Detection and Emulation of Algorithms from Execution Traces" carries out several tasks:

-) It develops a method to visualize the dynamic of the algorithms. Several kinds of programs are visualized.

-) The kinds of programs are classified by using neural networks.

-) It uses recurrent neural networks to detect sub-programs inside execution traces.

-) Finally, a method to predict the next step of an algorithm is presented. 


R2a: I am not sure that this paper is indicated for being published in the Journal Knowledge-Based Systems. I think that this journal has a different scope to that of work.

C: should mention the links to journal topics 1-by-1

R2b: On the other hand, an extensive comparison with other related methods is necessary in the experimental part of the paper. 

R2c: The area of application of the results is very reduced  (sorting and non-sorting programs on a numeric array).

R2d: I think that a section by comparing the methods presented with the concepts of cellular automata and finete state machines would be interesting.

C: check Dynamics Complex Behavior in Google Doc's graphical review
