Steps in review (Planning):

1. Fix minor and medium feedback items (1/2 done)
2. Read suggested papers
3. Discuss changes with co-author
	- abstract/introduction more concise wrt to the paper overview - Bipin
	- point out feedback wrt to the paper overview - Catalin
4. Restructure, more major feedback items, in any order (address each major feedback item separately)

## 2. Small Issues

1. fix "of of"
2. labels with two ":"
3. rephrase "Array does not - the data does" ???? -> However, the input data does not have an influence on the strategy of the algorithm while reversing an array.
4. fix "of a program - [5]" -> of a program [5]
5. fix reference to tables 1, 5, 6 & 8
6. fix "Heapsort in 7? What is this seven?"
7. proof reading
8. legend for fix types
9. re-representation -> This allows showcasing different set-ups complexities and improvements based on the data representation type and by designing better models of program induction.
10. "The type of a new previously unseen program can be predicted", explain why is this important -> This could prove relevant in deciding what type of problem the program solves and which aspects of the input data have a higher influence on the output data of the program.
