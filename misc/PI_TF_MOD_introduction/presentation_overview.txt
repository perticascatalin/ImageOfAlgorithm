0. Overview

1.A What is program induction?
1.B The ability to generate, replicate or infer code using a computer.

2. The Plan
2.A NOW: Write programs for computer to execute
2.B RESEARCH: Use data to develop models for writing programs
2.C DREAM: Let the computer write and execute its own program

3.A Example: Data from Star Trek sometimes writes programs to compute various results and subroutines for specific behavior.

3.B As follow-up, we can imagine that in order to achieve this task (100%) we would need machines capable of thinking, however...

THIS IS WHAT WE CAN DO TODAY

Present some papers

P1. DeepCoder (search speed-up using inference of program attributes)
	- specify domain specific language
	- encoding input-output pairs
	- map input/output pairs to program attributes
	- narrow program search using predicted program attributes

P2. Aster Project 
	- abstract syntax trees
	- reverse polish notation
	- encoding variable names
	- author, task, project, bug detection

P3. The one with program tree expansion - added
P4. Pix2Code

A8. The one with differentiable memory

4.C Tools for solving such problems (tensorflow, models)

Present some models (brief theory, tensorflow/keras implementation)

M1. MLP
	- formula, layers
	- input
	- Wx + b
	- activation
	- output
	- fully connected (dense)
M2. CNN
M3. LSTM

======================
By topics: Down to here 26 topics => ~3.5 minutes on average per topic
6 section strategy => 15 min/section (2.3 topics/section)

TEST: how much can you write/present for each topic in 3.5 mins, then adjust accordingly

Plan for:
4h writing speech (4 left)
2h detail presentation (2 left)
4h writing presentation DONE
2h running nn programs DONE
2h taking the test DONE
2h compose presentation DONE
2h whatever DONE

Feedback:
- write summaries, instead of hard teaching
- make a presentation (doing)
- skip tensorflow (- a lot)
- add pictures for ml overview (2 slides)
- get to program induction
- watch 2 min papers

Side Slide (to guide narrative)
===============

Slide 1: The Journey

In acest talk o sa povestesc pe scurt despre program induction,
un subdomeniu al inteligentei artificiale care cuprinde subiecte
din sfera automatizarii scrierii de cod.

Adica: aplicatii ale statisticii in software,
dar si moduri de a intelege retelele neuronale ca un mijloc de computatie.

Prin asta ma refer la abilitatea unui model adaptabil de a infera din date 
calculele pe care ar trebui sa le execute. 
In acest fel, un model poate fi vazut ca un program.

NEXT SLIDE
===============

Inter-slide

Ca si exemplu introductiv, ne putem gandi la o metoda necunoscuta care are un input, un output si o serie de instructiuni. Avand la dispozitie doar un set de inputs & outputs, exista posibilitatea de a genera secventa de instructiuni care mapeaza corect inputs pe outputs (si care generalizeaza)?

Slide 2: Program Representation [carrying out complex calculations]

Poster
R2D2
Code -> Data -> Code
Big Data

Ca sa putem raspunde la intrebare, trebuie sa vedem mai exact cum reprezentam un program in date/informatie. 

Normally, a program handles data, but in our case, the program becomes the data...

The Speech

- write program induction idea (1h, done)
- write for program representation (1h write 300 words that link well)
- write for learning to code (1h write 300 words that link well)
- tensorflow & models (1h)
- links, resources, conclusions ...

1 page program induction idea DONE
1 page tensorflow and models
1 page resources

In total 14 pages
With an average of 2 minutes per page, you will need intro (what program induction is) + 600 words for introductory part.
