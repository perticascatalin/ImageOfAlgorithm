0. Overview

1.A What is program induction?
1.B The ability to generate, replicate or infer code using a computer.

2. The Plan
2.A NOW: Write programs for computer to execute
2.B RESEARCH: Use data to develop models for writing programs
2.C DREAM: Let the computer write and execute its own program

3.A Example: Data from Star Trek sometimes writes programs to compute various results and subroutines for specific behavior.

3.B As follow-up, we can imagine that in order to achieve this task (100%) we would need machines capable of thinking, however...

THIS IS WHAT WE CAN DO TODAY

4. Chapters

4.A Machine learning overview

Computer Vision

Train with images to infer image properties:

- hand-written digit recognition
- object detection
- segmentation

Natural Language Processing

Train with text to infer text properties

- sentiment analysis
- spam detection
- translation

Program Induction

Train with code/IO pairs to infer code/IO pairs

- program synthesis
- neural programming
- software applications:
	- defect prediction
	- semantics extraction, grouping
	- target areas
