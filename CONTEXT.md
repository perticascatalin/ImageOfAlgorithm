# Introduction to Program Induction (Tensorflow & Models)

## Introduction to introduction

WHAT?

- The ability to generate, replicate or infer code using a computer.

HOW?

- **NOW**: Write programs for computer to execute.
- **RESEARCH**: Use data to develop models for writing programs
- **DREAM**: Let the computer write and execute its own program

## Tests

	> This is a blockquote
	> inside a list item.
	
<p>This is a normal paragraph:</p>

<pre><code># Sample program
include tensorflow as tf
num_steps = 1000
</code></pre>

## Challenges

- Finding meaningful program representations which can be
learned statistically
- Embedding together different types of representations
- Modelling the cognitive patterns which enable code
generation
