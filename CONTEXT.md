# Introduction to Program Induction (Tensorflow & Models)

## Introduction to introduction

WHAT?

- The ability to generate, replicate or infer code using a computer.

HOW?

- **NOW**: Write programs for computer to execute.
- **RESEARCH**: Use data to develop models for writing programs
- **DREAM**: Let the computer write and execute its own program

## Challenges

- Finding meaningful program representations which can be
learned statistically
- Embedding together different types of representations
- Modelling the cognitive patterns which enable code
generation
